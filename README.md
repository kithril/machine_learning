# machine_learning
My playground for understanding machine learning and tensorflow. All code is running in Python3.5.

I use Anaconda which I highly recommend. Let me know if you need a primer on it.

The neural-networks-and-deep-learning code can be obtained from https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning. The version there is compatible with Python2.7
